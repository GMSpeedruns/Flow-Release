This database is still populated with data, including times, because I thought, for the people that are actually interested in this, that those would be particularly fun to still have.
If you want to start fresh, you're best of creating a new SQLite3 database and inserting all data from "Structure only.sql" into it. It should be ready to go then.

With this version, there is no admin panel of sorts, so maps will have to be added by editing the sv.db file.

I believe "mapdata.sql" is a file I generated using a C# app, but I'm not sure. You might need it.

Enjoy it,
