There are some required lua autorun files for this release.

In Gamemode/ there are several versions.
The server started lagging very bad at one point, thus I remade it an called the laggy versions "LagXL".
I'm not sure what the cause was, so they might lag or they might not.

Regardless of that, I hope they're of use.
