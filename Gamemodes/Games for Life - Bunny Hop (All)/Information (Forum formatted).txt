As some of you might already have heard there has been a change of plan for the Bunny Hop server. I have been made Server Manager for the GFL Bunny Hop server on Garry's Mod and I have put on a CS:S like Gamemode that is rich of features and will make a great game to play for everyone.

[size=5]1. [b]Introduction[/b][/size]
I have changed the layout for this thread since there have been a numerous amount of updates all spread over a variety of threads, and I figured it would be useful if everything was compiled in one big and central thread so that information is easily accessible.
Fields covered in this thread will be a complete list of features, changes and bug fixes applied to the server. General bhop information will also be posted here.
If you have anything to suggest towards the bhop server or make any recommendations, please also post them here in this thread.

[size=5]3. [b]General Information[/b][/size]
[b]Gamemode Explanation[/b]
The point of the Bunny Hop gamemode is to test your manouvring skills and to complete maps with a varying difficulty. On GFL we provide you with a great environment to use these skills in. We offer you to display your skill in several Bunny Hop modes:
[LIST]
[*]Auto Hop: In this mode you will mainly be able to show your skill in strafing and speed; complete the maps with just your mouse and space bar. This is the only mode that will give you rank points.[/*]
[*]Scroll: In this mode you have to use your mouse wheel to complete maps, and timing will be a big part of your run. Strafing still plays a role.[/*]
[*]Sideways: This mode is all about showing your skill in being able to sideways-bhop. Auto Hop is enabled for this mode as scrolling mostly defeats the purpose.[/*]
[*]W-Only: In this mode you have to complete the map with just your W-key and the space bar. This is generally considered the most challenging mode.[/*]
[*]Bonus: This mode is only enable in some maps that have a bonus level. It is similar to the Auto Hop gamemode but does not give rank points. The levels are generally very short but can be challenging.[/*]
[*]Practice: In this mode you can practice the map we are playing. You have access to a set of new commands that will allow you to place yourself anywhere throughout the map and try the parts or levels you struggle with.[/*]
[/LIST]
Each of these modes are provided with a World Record list, except of course the Practice mode.

[b]Tutorials[/b]
[i]Below is a list of tutorials that will indefinitely help you along the way in the Bunny Hop gamemode.[/i]
[LIST]
[*]Bunny Hop Tutorial: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3j9ftTk4C8]Basic Bunny Hop[/url] (By Own3r)[/*]
[*]Bunny Hop Tutorial: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNvvQhXEWrs]Advanced Bunny Hop[/url] (By Own3r)[/*]
[*]Long Jump Tutorial: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKV7sxJrXB0]Long Jumps (XC)[/url] (By Own3r)[/*]
[/LIST]
 
[b]Game Functionality Explanation[/b]
[b]The rank system[/b]
Every map gives a certain amount of points for beating it. This can be done in any mode (except Practice and Bonus of course). To find out how many points a map gives, type !points.


All points you get will add up to a total. That total determines your rank.
If you look near the bottom of this thread or type !ranks in-game, you will see a list of ranks, and it will show the points you have.

[b]Practice Mode[/b]
This mode can be used to practice a map. Type !practice to change to practice mode. Once you're in practice mode timers will not influence you. You can type !pnoclip or !roam to go into noclip mode and explore the map and go to parts you struggle with. You can then type the command again to toggle it back off.

[b]Bots[/b]
Bots are for any mode. You have to improve the bot's previous time to get a bot.
You have to use the !bot record command to record yourself.

[b]F.A.Q[/b]
Q: Will we ever have Benchmark?
A: Possibly. Yes. Alright, we have it now.

Q: How can I get God?
A: Complete every map (Badges2, Benchmark and Aux_a9 are not required for this)
