If you want to improve your existing Bunny Hop gamemode, these snippets might be of use to you.
They're the 'core' of each Bunny Hop gamemode, and makes maps work the way they're meant to work.

They are named by what they represent.
AutoHop.lua: The code for a stable Auto Hop
cl_strafe.lua: HUD that shows more details about your keys (I used this in my tutorials)
MoveHook.lua: The code for custom airacceleration
MapInitialization.lua: The code you need to setup the map correctly (platforms and doors)
SinglePlatform.lua: The code required for proper Single Hop platforms in Garry's Mod (mpbhops from CS:S)


This code was established mostly thanks to George.

Enjoy!
