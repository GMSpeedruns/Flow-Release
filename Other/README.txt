This is just a collection of other stuff I made.

In /Visual you can find the icon and logo I use for my gamemodes, as well as the icons (with PSD) that I used for the icons of the scoreboard of my latest gamemode (v7.0+)
In /Tools there is a single .bat file that allows you to batch BZip2.
In /Config you can find the server.cfg that I use for almost all skill oriented gamemodes!

Hope it's of any use!
