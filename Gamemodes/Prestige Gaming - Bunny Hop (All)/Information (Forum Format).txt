[SIZE=3]1. [B]Introduction[/B][/SIZE]
I have changed the layout for this thread since there have been a numerous amount of updates all spread over a variety of threads, and I figured it would be useful if everything was compiled in one big and central thread so that information is easily accessible.
Fields covered in this thread will be a complete list of features, changes and bug fixes applied to the server. General bhop information will also be posted here.
If you have anything to suggest towards the bhop server or make any recommendations, please also post them here in this thread.

[/LIST]

[B][I]Changes[/I][/B]
[LIST]
[*]Changed the rank system yet again

- This rank is being shown on the !rank window
- Dynamic rank reloading is now working better than before
- Your rank points for a specific map are calculated likewise: 
- - If your time is more or equal than double the #1 WR time on that map, you will receive half the total obtainable points
- - If your time is less than double the #1 WR your points will be: Map Points * (#1 WR / Your Time) ; Time here is measured in seconds
- You can determine Map Points by either finishing the map or by typing !points
- When you finish a map you can see how many points of the total obtainable points you got
[*]You now spawn with the Glock
[*]Your ammo is now shown on the bottom right
[*]You can now use !spec or !spectate to toggle spectator mode directly

[SIZE=2][B]Update 1[/B][/SIZE]
[I]This was the first update I applied to the server where persistent bugs in George's gamemode were fixed. It has been a while and I don't exactly remember what this contained.[/I]


[SIZE=3]3. [B]General Information[/B][/SIZE]
[SIZE=2][B]Gamemode Explanation[/B][/SIZE]
The point of the Bunny Hop gamemode is to test your manouvring skills and to complete maps with a varying difficulty. On pG we provide you with a great environment to use these skills in. In pG we offer you to display your skill in several Bunny Hop modes:
[LIST]
[*]Auto Hop: In this mode you will mainly be able to show your skill in strafing and speed; complete the maps with just your mouse and space bar. This is the only mode that will give you rank points.
[*]Scroll: In this mode you have to use your mouse wheel to complete maps, and timing will be a big part of your run. Strafing still plays a role.
[*]Sideways: This mode is all about showing your skill in being able to sideways-bhop. Auto Hop is enabled for this mode as scrolling mostly defeats the purpose.
[*]W-Only: In this mode you have to complete the map with just your W-key and the space bar. This is generally considered the most challenging mode.
[*]Bonus: This mode is only enable in some maps that have a bonus level. It is similar to the Auto Hop gamemode but does not give rank points. The levels are generally very short but can be challenging.
[*]Practice: In this mode you can practice the map we are playing. You have access to a set of new commands that will allow you to place yourself anywhere throughout the map and try the parts or levels you struggle with.
[/LIST]
Each of these modes are provided with a World Record list, except of course the Practice mode.

[SIZE=2][B]Tutorials[/B][/SIZE]
[I]Below is a list of tutorials that will indefinitely help you along the way in the Bunny Hop gamemode.[/I]

[SIZE=2][B]Game Functionality Explanation[/B][/SIZE]
[B]The rank system[/B]
I know there has been some confusion about the rank system and the updates it received, so I will try to clarify the system as good as I can here.
The initial rank system, that we have gotten used to and the one that has been set in place by George, was based off getting a certain amount of points for completing a map, where these points would represent the relative difficulty and length of the map. Parts of this rank system have been taken over by me to be used in the newer rank system.
In the newer rank system, you still obtain points for completing a map, but the amount of points will be influenced by another factor here: Time.
If you complete a map (worth 500 points) and you get the #1 WR (e.g. 08:13 = 493 seconds), you have the best time for that map, and will thus receive the maximum amount of points for that map (as shown in the nominate window or the value you get when typing !points). Now, if there is another player who beats the map, there are two scenarios possible for him:
[LIST=1]
[*]He has finished the map with a time more than DOUBLE the #1 WR (e.g. 16:38)
> In this scenario the player has not performed well enough to be assigned a higher amount of points than half the total map points. The player will thus receive 250 points (500 / 2).
[*]He has finished the map with a time that lies within the double of the #1 WR (e.g. 10:47 = 647 seconds)
> In this scenario the player will receive points by the following formula: Map Points * (#1 Time / Your Time) = 500 * (493 / 647) = 381 Points out of 500 total
[/LIST]
Using this method players that can beat a map with a bad time will still get the points they deserve for at least showing the skill and capability to beat a map, and the players that can show more than this, like doing a perfect run of the map, will be rewarded with more points and thus easier ranking.

[B]Practice Mode[/B]
This is the rename of our old Teleportation Mode but greatly enhanced with new features. You can now 'no-clip' in practice mode by going into spectator (Free Roam); then typing !spawn to continue playing at this position.
You can also directly teleport to spectated players (this is shown at the top of your screen). On practice mode, similarly to Sideways and W-Only, you have access to Auto Hop (Hold space).

[B]Bots[/B]
Bots are for any mode now, but you have to improve the bot's previous time to get a bot.
To use the bot record function you have to either be halfway the rank ladder (Respected) or have a WR on that map.
