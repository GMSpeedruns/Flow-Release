How to make WJs possible on KZ maps
1. Go to gamemode/maps and copy kz_bhop_yonkoma.lua
2. Rename it to the map you want to enable WJs on
3. Open the Lua file. If you want to force the default style to legit don't change it, otherwise remove the 4th line

How to make the !playernames command work
1. Go to Release/Addons/Base GarrysMod Edits
2. Copy all the contents and paste it right inside of your GarrysModDS/garrysmod folder
3. If a prompt comes up to overwrite, back up your existing files and overwrite (unless GMOD lua has been updated)

Fix disconnection by "The server can't load essential data! Please wait until this problem is fixed"
1. To temporarily circumvent this problem, type this on your console and you should be able to join: lua_run Core.Locked = false
2. The reason for this is either you've waited too long with placing a zone on a newly added map, or
3. You haven't got any maps added to your sv.db's "game_map" table. You can manually insert an item here or, when bypassing the lockdown, set a multiplier for the map so that the table is updated.
